			<h2>Project Explorer</h2>
			<p>The project explorer is the main window for managing all projects within VICOScope. Although it is not possible to operate several devices in parallel, you can still operate all connected devices sequentially via the explorer.</p>
			<p>How to create a new project?
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li>To create a new project you can either use a mouse right-click>>[New Project] within an empty space inside the explorer or use the menu bar: [File]>>[New]>>[Project].</li>
				<li>The "New VICOProject Wizard" is starting:</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>A meaningful name for the project can be assigned within "Project Name".</li>
					<li>After clicking on [Browse], the storage location of the project including all future spectrum data can be defined.</li>
					<li>In order to assign a device to the project, you must first scan for connected devices (if the desired device is not already displayed.).</li>
					<li>Clicking on [Scan] opens the "Device Selection" window:</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li>Select or deselect the desired interface and define "Network/Prefix" for UDP and "IP Range" for TCP, if required. The default settings (all checkboxes enabled; UDP: Network = 192.168.0.0, Prefix = 24; TCP: IP Range = 192.168.0.2 - 192.168.0.2) can be retained when the device is put into operation for the first time.</li>
						<li>The device search is started by clicking on [Start].</li>
						<li>Depending on the selected settings, the search process can take several seconds.</li>
						<li>Selecting a device and clicking on [OK] will assign the device to the project. Note: It is also possible to create an "offline" project without choosing a device.</li>
						<li>After clicking on [Create], the wizard is finished and the new project is displayed in the explorer.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The explorer is grouped into three levels, which are now explained individually:
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li>Project</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>Via mouse right-click>>[Open Directory] the location of the project file, including all spectrum data, is shown in the file explorer of the operating system.</li>
					<li>The currently active project, for which the digital pulse processor (DPP) parameters are also displayed within the configuration view, is shown in bold. An inactive project can be activated with a mouse double left-click or via mouse right-click>>[Set to Active].</li>
					<li>If a device is assigned, the serial number is displayed in square brackets after the project name. If this is not the case, "offline" is shown in square brackets.</li>
					<li>The device of the project can be changed via mouse right-click>>[Device] if several devices are connected. In addition, the device selection can be run through again by mouse right-click>>[Device]>>[Scan].</li>
					<li>The diagnosis window can be opened with a mouse right-click>>[Diagnosis]. It provides an overview of various static and dynamic device information.</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li>The [Refresh] button updates all information once.</li>
						<li>The switch can be used to activate an auto-refresh mode, which updates all information once a second.</li>
						<li>The [Export] button can be used to save the displayed information as a JSON file. This might be helpful in support cases.</li>
						<li>The detector temperature can also be changed within the diagnosis window. A new target temperature must be entered under "SDD Temp/°C" and confirmed with [Apply]. The new target temperature is immediately used for control. After a refresh, the new set temperature is displayed.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The project and the associated folder on the host system can be renamed via mouse right-click>>[Rename].</li>
					<li>The project can be closed by mouse right-click>>[Close], or even completely deleted from the host system after confirmation.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Configuration</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>All spectra measured with the same DPP configuration are grouped. Each group has a suffix number as a unique identifier that is displayed after an underscore.</li>
					<li>Double-clicking on a configuration of any project automatically loads the associated DPP parameters. The next recorded spectrum is then saved in this configuration group within the active project.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Spectrum</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>Each spectrum is saved within the project folder as a *.vspc file with the time stamp as the default name in the format "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.vspc".</li>
					<li>In addition to the spectrum raw data and the DPP parameters, the file also contains further information on the measurement within the JSON structure. This includes, for example, run statistics, ROIs, version information of the firmware, hardware article and serial numbers as well as the start and end times of the measurement.</li>
					<li>The visibility can be switched off and on again for one or more selected spectra. Each visible spectrum is given a filled circle in the explorer in the color of the displayed spectrum.</li>
					<li>If a spectrum has been calibrated, this is shown in the circle to the left of the spectrum name. A "2" corresponds to a two-point calibration, a "1" stands for a one-point calibration and an uncalibrated spectrum does not get a number.</li>
					<li>The spectrum and the associated file on the host system can be renamed via mouse right-click>>[Rename].</li>
					<li>The spectrum can be deleted completely from the host system by mouse right-click>>[Delete], or pressing the delete key on the keyboard.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

		</div>
		<div id="Interface_Watch">
			<h2>Interface Watch</h2>
			<p>The interface watch view offers the possibility of following all VICOLib functions executed by VICOScope. The maximum number of rows is limited to 1000.</p>
			<p>Each line contains a time stamp according to ISO 8601 in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS and the VICOLib function name used. A hover box is displayed shortly after moving the pointer over a specific line. In addition to the status (e.g. success or detailed error), the arguments used for the VICOLib function call are also noted. An error is indicated using a red background.</p>
			<p>With the help of the [Clear] button, all lines are deleted and the interface watch is emptied.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Spectrum">
			<h2>Spectrum</h2>
			<p>A step function is used as a representation for the spectrum. The x-axis shows the energy in kiloelectron volts (Energy/keV). The events per channel are shown without unit of measurement on the y-axis (Events). If the spectrum is not calibrated, each channel has a width of 5eV. The center of the first channel is thus at 0eV and ranges from -2.5eV to +2.5eV. As soon as the spectrum is calibrated the channel width is adjusted according to the gain (see Analyze for more information). Up to 32 different colors are used to represent the spectra.</p>
			<p>By clicking on [Start], the spectrum recording within the active project is started. The start button immediately changes to [Pause] to allow the spectra acquisition to be paused. Using [Resume], which is shown now, the recording can be continued. [Stop], which was initially greyed out, can now be used to stop the spectra recording. If the stop condition defined in the configuration view is reached, the recording is automatically stopped.</p>
			<p>The switch can be used to toggle between a logarithmic and a linear representation.</p>
			<p>The current cursor position within the chart is indicated in the upper right corner. It is displayed in the form of an ordered pair: (Energy/keV, Events).</p>
			<p>As soon as an ROI has been selected within the analyze view and is no longer displayed transparently, you can move the ROI borders to the left and right within the chart with a mouse left-click (press and hold).</p>

			<h2>Oscilloscope</h2>
			<p>The oscilloscope view is used to acquire and display waveforms of internal digital pulse processor (DPP) signals for diagnostic purposes. Using the drop-down menu in the upper left the user can choose one of the following internal signals which can be acquired:
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li><b>ADC-Data</b>: Raw signal data of the ADC.</li>
				<li><b>Fastfilter</b>: Filter output of the fastfilter.</li>
				<li><b>Mediumfilter</b>: Filter output of the mediumfilter.</li>
				<li><b>Slowfilter</b>: Filter output of the slowfilter.</li>
				<li><b>Baseline-average</b>: Moving average of baseline mean value.</li>
				<li><b>Baseline-sample</b>: Latest acquired baseline values.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Furthermore, the user can set up the trigger condition and the sampling rate using the DPP parameters "Event Trigger Source", "Event Trigger Value", "Event Scope Sampling Interval", and "Event Scope Trigger Timeout" in the Configuration view.</p>
			<p>Using the [Get Scope] button the user can initiate the acquisition of the selected waveform using the current parameter settings. The DPP now will wait for the trigger condition to occur and then read out the selected waveform. In case the trigger condition is met during the configured timeout time, the acquired waveform will be displayed. Otherwise, an error message will be shown.</p>
			<p>On the x-axis of the plot the time in µs is shown. Depending on the chosen sampling rate VICOScope will automatically calculate the correct time values on the x-axis. The trigger moment is always at half of the waveform length (50% pre-trigger and 50% post-trigger). The y-axis shows digital signal values. Except for the ADC-data their absolute values have no practical use. For ADC-data however, the digital values are ADC codes where 0 corresponds to an analog voltage of -1V and 65535 corresponds to an analog voltage of +1V at the preamplifier input.</p>
			<p>Using the [Export] button the user can save the displayed waveform into a JSON file. This is useful in case further analysis of the data with external tools is needed.</p>
			<p>The plot of the displayed waveform supports the same user interactions as the Spectrum view (e.g., reset fit to view, scroll, zoom, ...).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Analyze">
			<h2>Analyze</h2>
			<p>Within the analyze view up to 16 regions of interest (ROI) can be defined. There are two ways to create a new ROI. Either within the analyze view using a mouse right-click>>[Add ROI] or with a mouse/keyboard action within the spectrum view. To delete a ROI, you can either mark the desired row inside the analyze view and press the delete key on the keyboard or remove the ROI via mouse right-click>>[Delete ROI] within a row.</p>
			<p>The following list describes each column of the displayed ROI table.</p>
			<p><i>Note: In the following, bin and channel are used interchangeably.</i></p>
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li><b>Color</b>: Fill color of the ROI.
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>If the ROI is selected, the color is displayed without transparency.</li>
					<li>If not, the color will be rendered with a slight transparency.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Lower/keV</b>: Low-energy end of the ROI in kiloelectron volts. Using mouse right-click>>[Auto-Adjust ROI] the lower value is automatically set to the lowest energy within the currently set ROI, which contains at least a quarter of the peak events. If the number of events at the low-energy end of the ROI is already equal to or more than a quarter of the peak events, the value is not changed.</li>
				<li><b>Upper/keV</b>: High-energy end of the ROI in kiloelectron volts. Using mouse right-click>>[Auto-Adjust ROI] the upper value is automatically set to the highest energy within the currently set ROI, which contains at least a quarter of the peak events. If the number of events at the high-energy end of the ROI is already equal to or more than a quarter of the peak events, the value is not changed.</li>
				<li><b>Events sum</b>: Sum of all events within the ROI.</li>
				<li><b>Events max</b>: Maximum height of all events within the ROI.</li>
				<li><b>Peak/keV</b>: Peak position in kiloelectron volts of the bin with the most events within the ROI. The exact energy including decimal places is calculated using the expected value of the bins:</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>First, the sum of the square of all events per channel is formed:</br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="19" src="Pictures/Equation_010.png" width="121"/></li>
					<li>Afterwards the sum of the weighted average over all energies within the ROI channels is used to calculate the position of the peak:</br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="26" src="Pictures/Equation_020.png" width="215"/></li>
					<li><i>Note:</i>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li><i>The bin size or the channel width of an uncalibrated raw spectrum is defined as 5eV/bin or 5eV/channel.</i></li>
						<li><i>Once the spectrum is calibrated, the bin size is multiplied by the gain. In addition, in the case of a two-point calibration, the peak is shifted by the offset (see Calibration/keV for more information).</i></li>
						<li><i>The energy of 0keV is defined for the first channel.</i></li>
						<li><i>The energy of the subsequent channels is a multiple of the bin size.</i></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>FWHM/keV</b>: Full width at half maximum of the peak is calculated as defined in ISO 15632:</li>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>Events max is the number of events of the peak within the ROI and corresponds to the peak intensity.</li>
					<li>The two channels or energies at the low- and high-energy side of the peak with the events just above and just below half of the peak intensity must be calculated.</li>
					<li>A linear interpolation between each pair is used to find those fractions of the channel or energy width that correspond exactly with the half maximum.</li>
					<li>The linear equation through one pair, e.g. (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) or (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), on each peak side is used:</br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="19" src="Pictures/Equation_030.png" width="182"/></li>
					<li>For the slope both pairs, e.g. (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) or (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>) and (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>), on each side must be used:</br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="24" src="Pictures/Equation_040.png" width="130"/> or <img style="vertical-align:middle" height="24" src="Pictures/Equation_050.png" width="130"/></li>
					<li>In order to get the fraction of the channel or energy, the equation must be rearranged:</br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_060.png" width="177"/> or <img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_070.png" width="177"/></li>
					<li>Both channels or energies, on the low- and high-energy side must be calculated:</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_080.png" width="307"/> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_090.png" width="308"/></li>
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_100.png" width="299"/> and <img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_110.png" width="299"/></li>
						
					</ul>
					<li>The uncalibrated FWHM is calculated as the interval, in channels or energies, between the two half-maximum positions (including fractional parts):</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="17" src="Pictures/Equation_120.png" width="287"/></li>
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="17" src="Pictures/Equation_130.png" width="268"/></li>
					</ul>
					<li>The conversion to the calibrated FWHM in electron volts is done as follows (see scaling factor and gain within Calibration/keV):</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="21" src="Pictures/Equation_140.png" width="507"/></li>
						<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="17" src="Pictures/Equation_150.png" width="402"/></li>
					</ul></li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Calibration/keV</b>: Optional energy in kiloelectron volts to calibrate the spectrum using a ROI peak.
				<p>The bin size or the channel width of an uncalibrated raw spectrum is defined as 5eV/bin or 5eV/channel. As soon as a spectrum is calibrated this value must be multiplied with the gain (see below for more details).</p></li>
				<p>It's possible to use one (one-point) or two peaks (two-point) for calibration:</p>
				<p>  </p>
				<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
					<li>One-point calibration:
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li>Using mouse right-click>>[Calibrate (one-point)], with only one row selected, the spectrum is calibrated (only available if an energy is specified in the calibration column for the selected ROI).</li>
						<li>The scaling factor and gain is calculated as follows:
						<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
							<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="22" src="Pictures/Equation_160.png" width="219"/></li>
							<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="27" src="Pictures/Equation_170.png" width="163"/></li>
						</ul>
						<li>The digital pulse processor (DPP) parameter Digital Energy Gain, within the configuration view, is adjusted as follows:<br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="15" src="Pictures/Equation_180.png" width="440"/></li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Two-point calibration:</li>
					<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
						<li>Using mouse right-click [Calibrate (two-point)], with two rows selected, the spectrum is calibrated (only available if an energy is specified in the calibration column for both selected ROIs).</li>
						<li>The scaling factor and gain is calculated as follows:</li>
						<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
							<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="23" src="Pictures/Equation_190.png" width="294"/></li>
							<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="27" src="Pictures/Equation_200.png" width="286"/></li>
						</ul>
						<li>The DPP parameter Digital Energy Gain, within the configuration view, is adjusted as follows:<br><img style="vertical-align:middle" height="15" src="Pictures/Equation_210.png" width="440"/></li>
						<li>The spectrum is shifted to the left or right by the offset.</li>
						<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">

			<h2>Configuration</h2>
			<p>The configuration view contains all digital pulse processor (DPP) parameters available to the end user. They are divided into four groups: I. Run Control, II. Pulse Processing, III. Hardware and Diagnostic, IV. Communication. Some of the parameters are only visible after toggling the switch from <b>Essential</b> to <b>Advanced</b>. This VICOScope help view features an individual description for each parameter, which is shown after clicking in the parameter row.</p>
			<p>In order to set up the DPP in a suitable way for a certain application, each parameter value in the configuration view can be adjusted. Depending on the data type of the parameter the user can ether:</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li>Select or de-select a checkbox for Boolean-type parameters.
				<li>Choose an entry using a drop-down menu for Enum-type parameters.
				<li>Type in a value for numerical-type parameters.
			</ul>
			<p>Since not every value is applicable for numerical-type parameters VICOScope might change the value entered by the user. VICOScope will find an applicable value which is as close as possible to the entered non-applicable value. In order to indicate that the user has entered a non-applicable value, the parameter will be highlighted with orange background color. As the value in the input box is changed to an applicable value in this case, a mouseover dialog informs the user which non-applicable was entered.</p>
			
			<p>With the buttons [Save] and [Load] data transfer with the non-volatile parameter data memory of the DPP can be controlled:</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
				<li><b>Save</b>: After changing a parameter within the configuration view, the new value is used for the next spectrum acquisition and is stored as the working copy in volatile memory inside the FPGA. Only after clicking on [Save], the value is saved non-volatile and will be used even after a power cycle.</li>
				<li><b>Load</b>: Non-overwritable default parameters that were written for the end user by KETEK upon delivery can be loaded via [Load]>>Default. The last saved parameters can be loaded via [Load]>>Saved. Unsaved changes must be discarded.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The user can find out for each parameter which value is currently stored within the non-volatile memory, by moving the pointer over the parameter entry. The displayed hover box shows the currently used parameter value, the parameter value stored in the default parameter set and the parameter value stored in the user parameter set. Furthermore, parameters are highlighted with yellow background color if the used parameter value does not match the saved value and parameters are highlighted with bold font, if the used parameter value does not match the default value.</p>

							<p>This parameter determines the size of the spectrum by setting the number of bins/channels used in the MCA. At a higher number of bins, the spectrum is more fine-grained and a wider energy range can be fitted into the MCA. However, data size and statistical errors increase with a higher number of bins.</p>

							<p>The gap time of the slowfilter is used to minimize ballistic deficit effects in the X-ray energy determination caused by the finite rise time of X-ray events. Long gap times offer an effective reduction of ballistic deficit effects (e.g., degradation of energy resolution, low-energy tail of peaks). However, long gap time increase the length of the slowfilter and therefore cause an increased dead time.</p>

						<td>Mediumfilter Trigger Threshold</td>
						<td id="Mediumfilter_Trigger_Threshold">Adjust the trigger threshold for pulse detection with the mediumfilter.
							<p>In case mediumfilter pulse detection is enabled, X-ray events are detected when the mediumfilter output exceeds this trigger threshold. Therefore, the mediumfilter trigger threshold should be chosen as low as possible in order to detect low-energy X-rays. However, at very low values the mediumfilter output will exceed the trigger threshold not only for X-ray events, but also for random noise. In this case a significant zero energy noise peak rises in the spectrum and dead time is increased.</p>

							<p>If this parameter is enabled the mediumfilter will be used instead of the fastfilter for the detection of X-ray events. Typically, the mediumfilter has a higher length compared to the fastfilter and therefore the detection of low energy X-rays can be improved. However, pile up rejection worsens in this case.</p>

						<td>Mediumfilter Maximum Width </td>
						<td id="Mediumfilter_Maximum_Width">Adjust the maximum width of the mediumfilter.
							<p>The maximum width is a secondary pile up criterion using the duration/width of the mediumfilter output above the mediumfilter trigger threshold. A detected X-ray is rejected in case this duration is higher than the defined maximum width and when using the mediumfilter for pulse detection.</p>
							<p>Choose a maximum width at least twice the mediumfilter peaking time expected the rise time of X-ray events. In order to disable this secondary pile up criterion choose a maximum width way above twice the mediumfilter peaking time plus maximum X-ray rise time.

						<td>Reset Inhibit Time</td>
						<td id="Reset_Inhibit_Time">Adjust the time duration for which the pulse processing is disabled after each detector reset.
							<p>Whenever a highly negative slope is detected in the detector signal the pulse processing is disabled in order to prevent a degradation of the spectrum due to detector resets. When the slope of the detection signal becomes positive again, pulse processing additionally stays disabled for the duration of the chosen reset inhibit time.</p>
							<p>Therefore, reset inhibit time should exceed the time needed by the detector to settle into normal operation after the reset slope becomes positive again. However, long reset inhibit times lead to higher dead times, most significantly at high input count rates and high X-ray energies.</p>

						<td id="Baseline_Average_Length">Adjust the number baseline samples used to calculate the running average of baseline value.
							<p>The baseline is the output of the slowfilter during the absence of X-ray events. A running average of the baseline is calculated using baseline samples acquired from the mediumfilter output in between X-ray events.</p>
							<p>Higher baseline average lengths reduce the noise introduced by baseline correction and might improve the energy resolution. However, the reaction time to changes in the baseline (e.g., due to change in detector temperature) worsens at high baseline average lengths. In most cases a high baseline average is the best choice.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Baseline Trim</td>
						<td id="Baseline_Trim">Adjust the baseline trim setting which determines the length of the mediumfilter.
							<p>Long mediumfilter provide less noisy baseline samples and reduce the need of baseline averaging. However, long mediumfilter can acquire baseline samples less frequently than a short mediumfilter because they take longer to return to the baseline after an X-ray event. In most cases an intermediate mediumfilter is the best choice.</p>

						<td>Baseline Correction Enable</td>
						<td id="Baseline_Correction_Enable">Enable or disable utilization of baseline correction.
							<p>The baseline is the output of the slowfilter during the absence of X-ray events. Main cause of a non-zero baseline is the presence of detector leakage current. When the baseline correction is enabled the current baseline average value is subtracted from each determined X-ray energy in order to eliminate the offset caused by detector leakage current. In most cases the utilization of the baseline correction is beneficial.</p>

					<tr>
						<td>Digital Energy Gain</td>
						<td id="Digital_Energy_Gain">Adjust the digital gain for energy values.
							<p>Every determined energy value will be multiplied with this gain. Therefore, large values will "stretch" and small values will "compress" the energy spectrum in the MCA data. Examples: 
							<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
								<li> A digital energy gain value of 5461 can be used for an MCA bin width of approximately 5eV/bin.</li>
								<li> A digital energy gain value of 4096 can be used for an MCA bin width of approximately 6.67eV/bin.</li>
								<li> A digital energy gain value of 2730 can be used for an MCA bin width of approximately 10eV/bin.</li>
								<li> A digital energy gain value of 1365 can be used for an MCA bin width of approximately 20eV/bin.</li>
								<li> A digital energy gain value of 10922 can be used for an MCA bin width of approximately 2.5eV/bin.</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>Please note that the exact value of eV/bin for a certain digital energy gain depends on the specific analog gain of the detector and preamplifier and might slightly differ due to component variations.</p>  
							<p>Together with the parameter "MCA Number of Bins" the digital energy gain also defines the maximum energy that fits into the MCA. Example: When using a MCA with 8192 bins and a digital energy gain of 5461, the maximum energy in the MCA is approximately 5eV/bin * 8192 bins = 40960eV.</p>

A value of 32768 equals to zero offset, a value of 0 equals to the maximum negative offset of 256 bins and a value of 65535 equals to the maximum positive offset of 256 bins. This parameter can be used to implement a 2-point energy calibration of the MCA on the device. Otherwise, a value of 32768 (zero offset) is the best choice in most cases.</p>

						<td>Dynamic Reset Enable</td>
						<td id="Dynamic_Reset_Enable">Enable or disable utilization of dynamic reset.
							<p>When enabled the DPP triggers the detector reset when the detector signal reaches the voltage set by the parameter "Dynamic Reset Threshold" and no X-ray event is currently processed. In most cases the detection efficient for high energy X-rays can be improved by enabling the dynamic reset.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Dynamic Reset Threshold</td>
						<td id="Dynamic_Reset_Threshold">Adjust the threshold for the dynamic reset.
							<p>When the dynamic reset is enabled by the parameter "Dynamic Reset Enable" the DPP triggers the detector reset when the detector signal reaches the voltage set by this parameter. The threshold voltage is set as ADC Code. The minimum code 0 corresponds to a signal voltage of -1V and the maximum code 65535 corresponds to a signal voltage of +1V. Therefore, each code represents about 30µV.</p>
							<p>A good practice to choose an appropriate threshold for the dynamic reset is to first determine the highest X-ray energy present in a certain application (e.g., excitation energy of 40keV). As a second step calculate the corresponding voltage of this energy using the KETEK default gain of 5mV/keV (e.g., 40keV correspond to 200mV) and convert to ADC codes of 30µV each (e.g., 200mV correspond to about 6667 ADC codes). Subtract the calculated amount of ADC codes from 65535 and choose a threshold for the dynamic reset about 2000 ADC codes lower than the result (e.g., subtraction of 6667 from 65565 gives 58898 and a good dynamic reset threshold would be about 57000). Using this method, a threshold for the dynamic reset can be found which still allows the detection of the highest X-ray energy prior to the detector reset.</p>
							<p>Also, the dynamic reset threshold can be optimized empirically for a certain application. In this case variate the dynamic reset threshold until the value is found at which the maximum output count rate is achieved. In most cases a suitable value is found in the range of 50000 to 60000.</p>

						<td>Dynamic Reset Duration</td>
						<td id="Dynamic_Reset_Duration">Adjust the duration of the dynamic reset output pulse from the DPP to the preamplifier.

									<li>Setting this parameter to a value of 10 results in a sampling frequency of 80MHz/10=8MHz for the signal trace. The 8192 data points represent a time frame of 8192/8MHz=1.024ms.</li>

							<p>Please note that after using the [Apply] button any ethernet connection with the device will be gone since the ethernet interface is reconfigured. Therefore, a new scan is needed after using the [Apply] button in case you are connected via ethernet to the device.</p>

						<td>Ethernet Protocol</td>
						<td id="Ethernet_Protocol">Choose the transport layer protocol used for ethernet communication. Supported protocols are:
							<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
								<li>TCP: Transmission Control Protocol</li>
								<li>UDP: User Datagram Protocol</li>
							</ul>

					<tr>
						<td>Ethernet Speed</td>
						<td id="Ethernet_Speed">Choose speed and duplex mode ethernet communication. Options are:
							<ul style="margin-left: -20px;">
								<li>AutoNegotiation: Use auto-negotiation to determine ethernet speed and duplex mode.</li>
								<li>FullDuplex100MBits: Force ethernet to run at 10Mbit/s and full duplex mode.</li>
								<li>FullDuplex10MBits: Force ethernet to run at 10Mbit/s and full duplex mode.</li>
								<li>HalfDuplex100MBits: Force ethernet to run at 100Mbit/s and half duplex mode.</li>
								<li>HalfDuplex10MBits: Force ethernet to run at 10Mbit/s and half duplex mode.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>In most cases the auto-negotiation options are suitable. The ethernet interface will automatically use the highest performance speed and duplex mode supported by each device present in the network.</p>
						<p>Forcing a specific ethernet speed using another option than auto-negotiation can cause the communication to fail (e.g., due to network switches that do not support the chosen option). However, not using auto-negotiation might be useful in case power consumption is critical since 10Mbit/s options draw significantly less power in comparison to 100Mbit/s options.</p>
